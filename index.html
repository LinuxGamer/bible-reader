        <h3 id="genesisc1">Chapter 1</h3>
        <p><sup>1</sup>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. <sup>2</sup>The earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the Spirit of God was moving over the face of the waters.</p>
        <p><sup>3</sup>And God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. <sup>4</sup>And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. <sup>5</sup>God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.</p>
        <p><sup>6</sup>And God said, “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.” <sup>7</sup>And God made the firmament and separated the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so. <sup>8</sup>And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.</p>
        <p><sup>10</sup>And God said, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so.</p>
