        <p><sup>1</sup>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. <sup>2</sup>The earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the Spirit of God was moving over the face of the waters.</p>
        <p><sup>3</sup>And God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. <sup>4</sup>And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. <sup>5</sup>God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.</p>
